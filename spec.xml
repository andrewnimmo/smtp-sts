<abstract>
<t>SMTP STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability
to receive TLS-secured connections, and to request sending SMTP servers to, when
delivering mail destined for the recipient domain, require TLS encryption, with
specified mechanisms for certificate validation, and/or to report TLS
negotiation failures.
</t>
</abstract>

<middle>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. In its current form, however, it fails
to provide (a) message confidentiality — because opportunistic STARTTLS is
subject to downgrade attacks — and (b) server authenticity — because the trust
relationship from email domain to MTA server identity is not cryptographically
validated.
</t>
<t>While such &quot;opportunistic&quot; encryption protocols provide a high barrier against
passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or who can
redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record
of the delivery domain) can perform such a downgrade or interception attack.
</t>
<t>This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies
specifying:
   * whether MTAs sending mail to this domain should expect TLS support
   * how MTAs can validate the TLS server certificate presented during mail
     delivery
   * what the recipient recommends should be done with messages when TLS cannot
     be successfully negotiated
</t>
<t>The protocol described is separated into three logical components:
   1. policy semantics: whether senders can expect a receiving server for the
      recipient domain to support TLS encryption, how to validate the TLS
      certificate presented, and what to do in case of failures
   2. failure report format: a mechanism for informing recipient domains about
      aggregate failure statistics
   3. policy authentication: how to determine the authenticity of a published
      policy delivered via DNS
</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
* Policy: An STS policy is a definition of the expected TLS availability for
  a given domain.
* Policy domain: The domain against which a policy is defined.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="related-technologies" title="Related Technologies">
<t>The DANE TLSA record <xref target="RFC7672"/> is similar, in that DANE is also designed to
upgrade opportunistic encryption into required encryption. DANE requires DNSSEC
<xref target="RFC4033"/> for the secure delivery of policies; the protocol described here
presents a variant for systems not yet supporting DNSSEC.
</t>

<section anchor="differences-from-dane" title="Differences from DANE">
<t>The primary difference between the protocol described here and DANE is that DANE
requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA records, whereas SMTP STS
relies on the certificate authority (CA) system and a trust-on-first-use (TOFU)
approach to avoid interception. The TOFU model allows a degree of security
similar to that of HPKP <xref target="RFC7469"/>, omitting both the complexity and the
guarantees on first use offered by DNSSEC. (For a thorough discussion of this
trade-off, see the section <spanx style="emph">Threat</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Model</spanx>.)
</t>
<t>In addition, SMTP STS introduces a mechanism for failure reporting and a
report-only mode, enabling progressive roll-out and auditing for compliance.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="advantages-when-used-with-dane" title="Advantages When Used with DANE">
<t>SMTP STS can be deployed for a recipient domain that also publishes a DANE TLSA
record for SMTP. In these cases, the SMTP STS policy can additionally declare a
process for failure reporting.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="advantages-when-used-without-dane" title="Advantages When Used Without DANE">
<t>When deployed without a DANE TLSA record, SMTP STS offers the following
advantages compared to DANE:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="emph">Infrastructure:</spanx> In comparison to DANE, this proposal does not require
 DNSSEC be deployed on either the sending or receiving domain. In addition,
 the reporting feature of SMTP STS can be deployed to perform offline
 analysis of STARTTLS failures, enabling mail providers to gain insight into
 the security of their SMTP connections without the need to modify MTA
 codebases directly.</t>
<t><spanx style="emph">Incrementalism:</spanx> DANE does not provide a reporting mechanism, nor does it
 have a concept of &quot;report-only&quot; failures; as a result, a service provider
 has no choice but to &quot;flip the switch&quot; and affect the entire mail stream at
 once.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="disadvantages-when-used-without-dane" title="Disadvantages When Used Without DANE">
<t>When deployed alone (i.e. without a DANE record, and using Web PKI for
certificate verification), SMTP STS offers the following disadvantages compared
to DANE:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Infrastructure: DANE may be easier for some providers to deploy. In
particular, for providers who already support DNSSEC, SMTP STS would
additionally require they obtain a CA-signed x509 certificate for the
recipient domain.</t>
<t>Security: DANE offers an advantage against policy-lookup DoS attacks; that is,
while a DNSSEC-signed NX response to a DANE lookup authoritatively indicates
the lack of a DANE record, such an option to authenticate policy non-existence
does not exist when looking up a policy over plain DNS.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-semantics" title="Policy Semantics">
<t>SMTP STS policies are distributed at the recipient domain either through a new
resource record, or as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies) under the name
&quot;_smtp_sts.” [Current implementations deploy as TXT records.] For example, for
the recipient domain &quot;example.com&quot;, the recipient's SMTP STS policy can be
retrieved from &quot;_smtp_sts.example.com.&quot;
</t>
<t>Policies must specify the following fields:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>v: Version (plain-text, required). Currently only &quot;STS1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t>to: TLS-Only (plain-text, required). If &quot;true,&quot; the messages to the policy
domain SHOULD be delivered only if they conform to the STS policy.</t>
<t>sto: Sends TLS-Only (plain-text, optional). If &quot;true&quot;, messages from the
policy domain are expected to be delivered via TLS; recipient domains SHOULD
report deviations from this as described in <spanx style="emph">Failure</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Reporting</spanx>.</t>
<t>mx: MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX match patterns,
required). One or more comma-separated patterns matching the expected MX for
the policy domain. For example, &quot;<spanx style="emph">.example.com,</spanx>.example.net&quot; indicates that
mail for this domain might be handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain
of &quot;example.com&quot; or &quot;example.net.&quot;</t>
<t>smx: Sending MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX match
patterns, required if &quot;sto&quot; is set). One or more comma-separated patterns
matching the expected PTR-RR of the IP address of the sending MTA for mail
received from the policy domain. The corresponding A/AAAA-RR also must point
back to the sending IP address.</t>

&quot;m&quot; for megabytes, &quot;g&quot; for gigabytes, &quot;t&quot; for terabytes).  Without a
unit, the number is presumed to be a basic byte count.  Note that the
units are considered to be powers of two; a kilobyte is 2^10, a
megabyte is 2^20, etc.

</section>

<section anchor="policy-expirations" title="Policy Expirations">
<t>In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP STS policies
are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically greater than two weeks.
Policy validity is controlled by two separate expiration times: the lifetime
indicated in the policy (&quot;e=&quot;) and the TTL on the DNS record itself. The policy
expiration will ordinarily be longer than that of the DNS TTL, and senders
should cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient domain) until
the policy expiration.
</t>
<t>An important consideration for domains publishing a policy is that senders may
potentially see a policy expiration as relative to the fetch of a policy cached
by their recursive resolver. Consequently, a sender may treat a policy as valid
for up to {expiration time} + {DNS TTL}. Publishers should thus continue to
expect senders to apply old policies for up to this duration.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="failure-reporting" title="Failure Reporting">
<t>Aggregate statistics on policy failures should be reported to the URI indicated
in the &quot;rua&quot; field of the policy. SMTP STS reports contain information about
policy failures to allow diagnosis of misconfigurations and malicious activity.
These are verbose, and may not be desirable in regular production. Aggregate
reports contain tallies of policy failures, and are more appropriate for regular
use.
</t>
<t>Aggregate reports contain the following fields:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>The SMTP STS policy applied (as a string)</t>
<t>The beginning and end of the reporting period</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Repeated records contain the following fields:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Failure type: This list will start with the minimal set below, and is expected
to grow over time based on real-world experience. The initial set is:</t>
<t>mx-mismatch: This indicates that the MX resolved for the recipient domain did
not match the MX constraint specified in the policy.</t>
<t>smx-mismatch: This indicates that the sending MX resolved for the sending
domain did not match the MX constraint specified in the policy.</t>
<t>certificate-mismatch: This indicates that the certificate presented by the
receiving MX did not match the MX hostname</t>
<t>invalid-certificate: This indicates that the certificate presented by the
receiving MX did not validate according to the policy validation constraint.
(Either it was not signed by a trusted CA or did not match the DANE TLSA
record for the recipient MX.)</t>
<t>expired-certificate: This indicates that the certificate has expired.</t>
<t>starttls-not-supported: This indicates that the recipient MX did not support
STARTTLS.</t>
<t>starttls-not-issued: This indicates that the sending MX did not issue
STARTTLS, although the corresponding policy for the sender domain requires it.</t>
<t>tls-not-negotiable: This indicates that the recipient MX did support
STARTTLS, but no session was negotiable (e.g. no common ciphers found).</t>
<t>Count: The number of times the error was encountered.</t>
<t>Hostname: The hostname of the recipient MX.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report may contain
overlapping counts of failure types where a single send attempt encountered
multiple errors.
</t>
<t>When sending failure reports, sending MTAs should not honor SMTP STS or DANE
TLSA failures.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-authentication" title="Policy Authentication">
<t>The security of a domain implementing an SMTP STS policy against an active
man-in-the-middle depends primarily upon the long-lived caching of policies.
However, to allow recipient domains to safely serve new policies <spanx style="emph">prior</spanx> to the
expiration of a cached policy, and to prevent long-term (either malicious or
active) denials of service, it is important that senders are able to validate a
new policy retrieved for a recipient domain. There are two supported mechanisms
for policy validation:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Web PKI: In this mechanism, indicated by the &quot;webpki&quot; value of the &quot;a&quot; field,
the sender fetches a HTTPS resource from the URI indicated. For example,
a=webpki:<eref target="https://example.com/.well-known/smtp_sts/current"/> indicates that the
sender should fetch the resource
<eref target="https://example.com/.well-known/smtp_sts/current"/>. The HTTP response body
served at this resource must exactly match the policy initially loaded via the
DNS TXT method, and must be served from an HTTPS endpoint at the domain
matching that of the recipient domain.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>(<spanx style="emph">TODO:</spanx> As this RFC standard progresses, the authors will register
.well-known/smtp-sts. See [@!RFC5785}}. Then implementors will <spanx style="emph">not</spanx> specify a
URI, but will instead rely on the .well-known URL.)
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>DNSSEC: In this mechanism, indicated by the &quot;dnssec&quot; value of the &quot;a&quot; field,
the sender must retrieve the policy via a DNSSEC signed response for the
_smtp_sts TXT record.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>When fetching a new policy when one is not already known, or when fetching a
policy for a domain with an expired policy, unauthenticated policies should be
trusted and honored. When fetching a policy and authenticating it, as described
in detail in <spanx style="emph">Policy</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Application</spanx>, policies will be authenticated using the
mechanism specified by the existing cached policy.
</t>
<t>Note, however, as described in detail in <spanx style="emph">Policy</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Application</spanx>, that new
policies should not be considered as valid if they do not validate on first
application. That is, a freshly fetched (and unused) policy that has not
successfully been applied should be disregarded.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-validation" title="Policy Validation">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and
non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS should validate
that the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a TLS certificate which is
valid according to the semantics of the SMTP STS policy. Policies can specify
validation methods by setting the values of the &quot;c&quot; field in the policy
description. If multiple methods are specified, at least one method in the
&quot;c&quot; field must be validated.
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Web PKI: When the &quot;c&quot; field is set to &quot;webpki&quot;, the certificate presented by
the receiving MX must be valid for the MX name and chain to a root CA that is
trusted by the sending MTA. The certificate must have a CN or SAN matching the
MX hostname (as described in <xref target="RFC6125"/>) and be non-expired.</t>
<t>DANE TLSA: When the &quot;c&quot; field is set to &quot;tlsa&quot;, the receiving MX should be
covered by a DANE TLSA record for the recipient domain, and the presented
certificate should be valid according to that record (as described by
<xref target="RFC7672"/>).</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-application" title="Policy Application">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid non-expired
SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS can apply the result of a
policy validation one of two ways:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Report-only: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report to the designated
report address indicating policy application failures. This can be done
&quot;offline&quot;, i.e. based on the MTA logs, and is thus a suitable low-risk option
for MTAs who wish to enhance transparency of TLS tampering without making
complicated changes to production mail-handling infrastructure.</t>
<t>Enforced: In this mode, sending MTAs should treat STS policy failures, in
which the policy action is &quot;reject&quot;, as a mail delivery error, and should
terminate the SMTP connection, not delivering any more mail to the recipient
MTA.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>In enforced mode, however, sending MTAs should first check for a new
<spanx style="emph">authenticated</spanx> policy before actually treating a message failure as fatal.
</t>
<t>Thus the control flow for a sending MTA that does online policy application
consists of the following steps:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Check for cached non-expired policy. If none exists, fetch the latest and
cache it.</t>
<t>Validate recipient MTA against policy. If valid, deliver mail.</t>
<t>If policy invalid and policy specifies reporting, generate report.</t>
<t>If policy invalid and policy specifies rejection, perform the following
steps: a. Check for a new (non-cached) <spanx style="emph">authenticated</spanx> policy. If one exists,
update the current policy and go to step 1.  b. If none exists or the newly
fetched policy also fails, treat the delivery as a failure.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Understanding the details of step 4 is critical to understanding the behavior of
the system as a whole.
</t>
<t>Remember that each policy has an expiration time (which may be long, on the
order of months) and a validation method. With these two mechanisms and the
procedure specified in step 4, recipients who publish a policy have, in effect,
a means of updating a cached policy at arbitrary intervals, without the risks
(of a man-in-the-middle attack) they would incur if they were to shorten the
policy expiration time.

<t>SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via either TLS
identity checking <xref target="RFC6125"/> or DANE TLSA <xref target="RFC7672"/>. Attackers who are able
to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by
compromising a certificate authority) are thus out of scope of this threat
model.

The owner wishes to begin using STS
with a policy that will solicit aggregate feedback from receivers
without affecting how the messages are processed, in order to:

* Confirm that its legitimate messages are sent over TLS

* Verify the validity of the certificates

* Verify what cyphers are in use

* Determine how many messages would be affected by a strict policy
