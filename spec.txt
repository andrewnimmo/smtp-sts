                     SMTP Strict Transport Security
                       draft-ietf-uta-smtp-sts-01

Abstract

   SMTP STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare
   their ability to receive TLS-secured connections, and to request
   sending SMTP servers to, when delivering mail destined for the
   recipient domain, require TLS encryption, with specified mechanisms
   for certificate validation, and/or to report TLS negotiation
   failures.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS.  In its current
   form, however, it fails to provide (a) message confidentiality --
   because opportunistic STARTTLS is subject to downgrade attacks -- and



Margolis, et al.        Expires September 9, 2016               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   (b) server authenticity -- because the trust relationship from email
   domain to MTA server identity is not cryptographically validated.

   While such "opportunistic" encryption protocols provide a high
   barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any
   attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250
   STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session
   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform such a downgrade or interception attack.

   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying: * whether MTAs sending mail to this domain
   should expect TLS support * how MTAs can validate the TLS server
   certificate presented during mail delivery * what the recipient
   recommends should be done with messages when TLS cannot be
   successfully negotiated

   The protocol described is separated into three logical components: 1.
   policy semantics: whether senders can expect a receiving server for
   the recipient domain to support TLS encryption, how to validate the
   TLS certificate presented, and what to do in case of failures 2.
   failure report format: a mechanism for informing recipient domains
   about aggregate failure statistics 3. policy authentication: how to
   determine the authenticity of a published policy delivered via DNS

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
   * Policy: An STS policy is a definition of the expected TLS
   availability for a given domain.  * Policy domain: The domain against
   which a policy is defined.

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade opportunistic encryption into required
   encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033] for the secure delivery
   of policies; the protocol described here presents a variant for
   systems not yet supporting DNSSEC.

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


2.1.  Differences from DANE

   The primary difference between the protocol described here and DANE
   is that DANE requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA
   records, whereas SMTP STS relies on the certificate authority (CA)
   system and a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach to avoid
   interception.  The TOFU model allows a degree of security similar to
   that of HPKP [RFC7469], omitting both the complexity and the
   guarantees on first use offered by DNSSEC.  (For a thorough
   discussion of this trade-off, see the section _Threat_ _Model_.)

   In addition, SMTP STS introduces a mechanism for failure reporting
   and a report-only mode, enabling progressive roll-out and auditing
   for compliance.

2.2.  Advantages When Used with DANE

   SMTP STS can be deployed for a recipient domain that also publishes a
   DANE TLSA record for SMTP.  In these cases, the SMTP STS policy can
   additionally declare a process for failure reporting.

2.3.  Advantages When Used Without DANE

   When deployed without a DANE TLSA record, SMTP STS offers the
   following advantages compared to DANE:

   o  _Infrastructure:_ In comparison to DANE, this proposal does not
      require DNSSEC be deployed on either the sending or receiving
      domain.  In addition, the reporting feature of SMTP STS can be
      deployed to perform offline analysis of STARTTLS failures,
      enabling mail providers to gain insight into the security of their
      SMTP connections without the need to modify MTA codebases
      directly.

   o  _Incrementalism:_ DANE does not provide a reporting mechanism, nor
      does it have a concept of "report-only" failures; as a result, a
      service provider has no choice but to "flip the switch" and affect
      the entire mail stream at once.

2.4.  Disadvantages When Used Without DANE

   When deployed alone (i.e. without a DANE record, and using Web PKI
   for certificate verification), SMTP STS offers the following
   disadvantages compared to DANE:

   o  Infrastructure: DANE may be easier for some providers to deploy.
      In particular, for providers who already support DNSSEC, SMTP STS




Margolis, et al.        Expires September 9, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


      would additionally require they obtain a CA-signed x509
      certificate for the recipient domain.

   o  Security: DANE offers an advantage against policy-lookup DoS
      attacks; that is, while a DNSSEC-signed NX response to a DANE
      lookup authoritatively indicates the lack of a DANE record, such
      an option to authenticate policy non-existence does not exist when
      looking up a policy over plain DNS.

3.  Policy Semantics

   SMTP STS policies are distributed at the recipient domain either
   through a new resource record, or as TXT records (similar to DMARC
   policies) under the name "_smtp_sts."  [Current implementations
   deploy as TXT records.]  For example, for the recipient domain
   "example.com", the recipient's SMTP STS policy can be retrieved from
   "_smtp_sts.example.com."

   Policies must specify the following fields:

   o  v: Version (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STS1" is
      supported.

   o  to: TLS-Only (plain-text, required).  If "true," the messages to
      the policy domain SHOULD be delivered only if they conform to the
      STS policy.

   o  sto: Sends TLS-Only (plain-text, optional).  If "true", messages
      from the policy domain are expected to be delivered via TLS;
      recipient domains SHOULD report deviations from this as described
      in _Failure_ _Reporting_.

   o  mx: MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX match
      patterns, required).  One or more comma-separated patterns
      matching the expected MX for the policy domain.  For example,
      "_.example.com,_.example.net" indicates that mail for this domain
      might be handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain of
      "example.com" or "example.net."

   o  smx: Sending MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX
      match patterns, required if "sto" is set).  One or more comma-
      separated patterns matching the expected PTR-RR of the IP address
      of the sending MTA for mail received from the policy domain.  The
      corresponding A/AAAA-RR also must point back to the sending IP
      address.

   o  a: The mechanisms available to use to authenticate this policy
      itself (required, comma-separated list).  See the section _Policy_
      _Authentication_ for more details.  Possible values are:

      *  webpki:URI, where URI points to an HTTPS resource at the
         recipient domain that serves the same policy text.

      *  dnssec: Indicating that the policy is expected to be served
         over DNSSEC.

   o  c: Constraints on the recipient MX's TLS certificate (plain-text,
      required, comma-separated list).  See the section _Policy_
      _Validation_ for more detais.  Possible values are:

      *  webpki: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the
         recipient MX must be valid according to the "web PKI"
         mechanism.

      *  tlsa: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the
         recipient MX must match a (presumed to exist) DANE TLSA record.

   o  e: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text integer seconds).  Well-
      behaved clients should cache a policy for up to this value from
      last policy fetch time.

   o  rua: Address to which aggregate feedback should be sent (comma-
      separated plain-text list of email addresses, optional).  For
      example, "mailto:postmaster@example.com" from [RFC3986].

   o  ruf: Address to which detailed forensic reports should be sent

   A size limitation in a sts-uri, if provided, is interpreted as a
   count of units followed by an OPTIONAL unit size ("k" for kilobytes,

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, "t" for terabytes).  Without a
   unit, the number is presumed to be a basic byte count.  Note that the
   units are considered to be powers of two; a kilobyte is 2^10, a
   megabyte is 2^20, etc.

5.  Policy Expirations

   In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP STS
   policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically
   greater than two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by two
   separate expiration times: the lifetime indicated in the policy
   ("e=") and the TTL on the DNS record itself.  The policy expiration
   will ordinarily be longer than that of the DNS TTL, and senders
   should cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient
   domain) until the policy expiration.

   An important consideration for domains publishing a policy is that
   senders may potentially see a policy expiration as relative to the
   fetch of a policy cached by their recursive resolver.  Consequently,
   a sender may treat a policy as valid for up to {expiration time} +
   {DNS TTL}. Publishers should thus continue to expect senders to apply
   old policies for up to this duration.

6.  Failure Reporting

   Aggregate statistics on policy failures should be reported to the URI
   indicated in the "rua" field of the policy.  SMTP STS reports contain
   information about policy failures to allow diagnosis of
   misconfigurations and malicious activity.  These are verbose, and may
   not be desirable in regular production.  Aggregate reports contain
   tallies of policy failures, and are more appropriate for regular use.

   Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

   o  The SMTP STS policy applied (as a string)

   o  The beginning and end of the reporting period

   Repeated records contain the following fields:

   o  Failure type: This list will start with the minimal set below, and
      is expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  The
      initial set is:

   o  mx-mismatch: This indicates that the MX resolved for the recipient
      domain did not match the MX constraint specified in the policy.





Margolis, et al.        Expires September 9, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   o  smx-mismatch: This indicates that the sending MX resolved for the
      sending domain did not match the MX constraint specified in the
      policy.

   o  certificate-mismatch: This indicates that the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX did not match the MX hostname

   o  invalid-certificate: This indicates that the certificate presented
      by the receiving MX did not validate according to the policy
      validation constraint.  (Either it was not signed by a trusted CA
      or did not match the DANE TLSA record for the recipient MX.)

   o  expired-certificate: This indicates that the certificate has
      expired.

   o  starttls-not-supported: This indicates that the recipient MX did
      not support STARTTLS.

   o  starttls-not-issued: This indicates that the sending MX did not
      issue STARTTLS, although the corresponding policy for the sender
      domain requires it.

   o  tls-not-negotiable: This indicates that the recipient MX did
      support STARTTLS, but no session was negotiable (e.g. no common
      ciphers found).

   o  Count: The number of times the error was encountered.

   o  Hostname: The hostname of the recipient MX.

   Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report
   may contain overlapping counts of failure types where a single send
   attempt encountered multiple errors.

   When sending failure reports, sending MTAs should not honor SMTP STS
   or DANE TLSA failures.

7.  Policy Authentication

   The security of a domain implementing an SMTP STS policy against an
   active man-in-the-middle depends primarily upon the long-lived
   caching of policies.  However, to allow recipient domains to safely
   serve new policies _prior_ to the expiration of a cached policy, and
   to prevent long-term (either malicious or active) denials of service,
   it is important that senders are able to validate a new policy
   retrieved for a recipient domain.  There are two supported mechanisms
   for policy validation:




Margolis, et al.        Expires September 9, 2016               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   o  Web PKI: In this mechanism, indicated by the "webpki" value of the
      "a" field, the sender fetches a HTTPS resource from the URI
      indicated.  For example, a=webpki:[1] indicates that the sender
      should fetch the resource [2].  The HTTP response body served at
      this resource must exactly match the policy initially loaded via
      the DNS TXT method, and must be served from an HTTPS endpoint at
      the domain matching that of the recipient domain.

   (_TODO:_ As this RFC standard progresses, the authors will register
   .well-known/smtp-sts.  See [@!RFC5785}}. Then implementors will _not_
   specify a URI, but will instead rely on the .well-known URL.)

   o  DNSSEC: In this mechanism, indicated by the "dnssec" value of the
      "a" field, the sender must retrieve the policy via a DNSSEC signed
      response for the _smtp_sts TXT record.

   When fetching a new policy when one is not already known, or when
   fetching a policy for a domain with an expired policy,
   unauthenticated policies should be trusted and honored.  When
   fetching a policy and authenticating it, as described in detail in
   _Policy_ _Application_, policies will be authenticated using the
   mechanism specified by the existing cached policy.

   Note, however, as described in detail in _Policy_ _Application_, that
   new policies should not be considered as valid if they do not
   validate on first application.  That is, a freshly fetched (and
   unused) policy that has not successfully been applied should be
   disregarded.

8.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS
   should validate that the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a
   TLS certificate which is valid according to the semantics of the SMTP
   STS policy.  Policies can specify validation methods by setting the
   values of the "c" field in the policy description.  If multiple
   methods are specified, at least one method in the "c" field must be
   validated.

   o  Web PKI: When the "c" field is set to "webpki", the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX must be valid for the MX name and
      chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA.  The
      certificate must have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname (as
      described in [RFC6125]) and be non-expired.

   o  DANE TLSA: When the "c" field is set to "tlsa", the receiving MX
      should be covered by a DANE TLSA record for the recipient domain,

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


      and the presented certificate should be valid according to that
      record (as described by [RFC7672]).

9.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS can
   apply the result of a policy validation one of two ways:

   o  Report-only: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report to
      the designated report address indicating policy application
      failures.  This can be done "offline", i.e. based on the MTA logs,
      and is thus a suitable low-risk option for MTAs who wish to
      enhance transparency of TLS tampering without making complicated
      changes to production mail-handling infrastructure.

   o  Enforced: In this mode, sending MTAs should treat STS policy
      failures, in which the policy action is "reject", as a mail
      delivery error, and should terminate the SMTP connection, not
      delivering any more mail to the recipient MTA.

   In enforced mode, however, sending MTAs should first check for a new
   _authenticated_ policy before actually treating a message failure as
   fatal.

   Thus the control flow for a sending MTA that does online policy
   application consists of the following steps:

   1.  Check for cached non-expired policy.  If none exists, fetch the
       latest and cache it.

   2.  Validate recipient MTA against policy.  If valid, deliver mail.

   3.  If policy invalid and policy specifies reporting, generate
       report.

   4.  If policy invalid and policy specifies rejection, perform the
       following steps: a.  Check for a new (non-cached) _authenticated_
       policy.  If one exists, update the current policy and go to step
       1.  b.  If none exists or the newly fetched policy also fails,
       treat the delivery as a failure.

   Understanding the details of step 4 is critical to understanding the
   behavior of the system as a whole.

   Remember that each policy has an expiration time (which may be long,
   on the order of months) and a validation method.  With these two
   mechanisms and the procedure specified in step 4, recipients who

   publish a policy have, in effect, a means of updating a cached policy
   at arbitrary intervals, without the risks (of a man-in-the-middle
   attack) they would incur if they were to shorten the policy
   expiration time.

10.  IANA Considerations

   There are no identifiers defined herein to be reserved by IANA.

11.  Security Considerations

   SMTP Strict Transport Security protects against an active attacker
   who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
   STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:

   o  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
      STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
      negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring over
      plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   o  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
      might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
      and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
      impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record
      for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections to
      the legitimate recipient server (for example, by altering BGP
      routing tables).

   SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via
   either TLS identity checking [RFC6125] or DANE TLSA [RFC7672].
   Attackers who are able to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted
   recipient mail service (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority)
   are thus out of scope of this threat model.

13.  Appendix 2: Domain Owner STS example record


    The owner wishes to begin using STS
    with a policy that will solicit aggregate feedback from receivers
    without affecting how the messages are processed, in order to:

    * Confirm that its legitimate messages are sent over TLS

    * Verify the validity of the certificates

    * Verify what cyphers are in use

    * Determine how many messages would be affected by a strict policy

                         "rua=mailto:sts-feedback@example.com " )
